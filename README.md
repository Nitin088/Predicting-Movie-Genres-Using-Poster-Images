# Predicting-Movie-Genres-Using-Poster-Images

This project aims to predict movie genres using poster images through a deep learning model. The model is trained to classify movies into various genres based on their visual features in the poster. This approach uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are well-suited for image classification tasks.

# Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from Kaggle. It contains movie posters and their corresponding genres.

- **Dataset source:** [Movie Genre from Poster](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neha1703/movie-genre-from-its-poster)

# Results
After training the model on a dataset of movie posters, the results of the evaluation on the test set are as follows:

-**Test Loss**: 0.5519
</br>
-**Test Accuracy**: 37.06%
</br>
-**Test Top-3 Accuracy**: 76.09%
</br>

These metrics indicate that the model performs reasonably well, but there is still room for improvement. The top-3 accuracy suggests that, in most cases, the correct genre appears in the top 3 predicted genres.
